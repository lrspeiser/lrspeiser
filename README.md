# Hi, I'm Leonard 👋

I don’t know how to code. But I do know how to *command* code — with the help of powerful Large Language Models like GPT and Claude.

Most of the code in my repositories wasn't typed by me, but by AI systems working under my creative direction. I use LLMs as collaborators to turn my ideas into functioning software, often exploring new ways these tools can shape user experiences, educational platforms, and simulations.

## 🔧 What I Build

I build things powered by LLMs — whether they're interactive games, educational experiments, or tools that stretch the imagination. Some highlights:

### 🦙 [Alpaca.is](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Alpaca.is)  
**Interactive City Exploration App**  
> A mobile-first platform that gamifies travel through AI-generated, city-specific bingo cards. Designed for students and explorers, Alpaca encourages discovery through:
> - Unique local activities per destination  
> - Optional photo-based check-ins  
> - Progress tracking across cities  
> - AI-personalized travel prompts and challenges

### 🧠 [Wordy](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Wordy)  
**AI-Powered Thematic Crossword Generator**  
> Generates 4x4 themed crossword puzzles using GPT-4.1. Each puzzle includes:
> - Original clues and creative titles  
> - Thematic coherence with educational value  
> - Persistent saves for replayability  
> - A unique gameplay experience every time

### 🕹 [Grue.is](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Grue.is)  
**Historical RPG Meets LLM**  
> A GPT/Claude-powered game inspired by *Oregon Trail* but with infinite historical rabbit holes. The LLM *is* the dungeon master.

### 🎯 [ForceRank](https://github.com/lrspeiser/ForceRank)  
**Debate-Driven Ranking Game**  
> Rank your preferences, debate with friends, settle disagreements, and discover collective priorities. A social game designed with the help of LLMs.

### 🧩 [Kazuke](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Kazuke)  
**Number Puzzle Game**  
> A fast-paced mental math game with puzzle strategy, created using LLMs as design partners.

### 🔁 [Node-GPT-Template](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Node-GPT-Template)  
**Start Here for GPT Apps**  
> A boilerplate project to build GPT-powered Node.js web apps. Supports:
> - Chat history per user  
> - Streaming response to browser  
> - Clean session management

### 🌀 [RotationalCosmology](https://github.com/lrspeiser/RotationalCosmology)  
**A Gödel-Inspired Hypothesis**  
> A speculative cosmology experiment where redshift is driven by universal frame-dragging, not expansion. Built to explore ideas with real astrophysics data.

## 🤖 Philosophy

I treat LLMs like junior engineers with superpowers:
- I give them instructions.
- They write the code.
- I direct, debug, and deploy.

Coding knowledge is optional in the age of AI. Imagination, curiosity, and good prompts are not.

> “The best way to predict the future is to build it… or prompt it.”
