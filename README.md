# Hi, I'm Leonard 👋

I don’t know how to code. But I do know how to *command* code — with the help of powerful Large Language Models like GPT and Claude.

Most of the code in my repositories wasn't typed by me, but by AI systems working under my creative direction. I use LLMs as collaborators to turn my ideas into functioning software, often exploring new ways these tools can shape user experiences, educational platforms, and simulations.

## 🔧 What I Build
I build things powered by LLMs — whether they're interactive games, educational experiments, or tools that stretch the imagination. Some highlights:

### 🕹 [Grue.is](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Grue.is)
> A GPT/Claude-powered game inspired by *Oregon Trail* but with infinite historical rabbit holes. Where the LLM *is* the dungeon master. Built entirely with LLMs under my direction.

### 🎯 [ForceRank](https://github.com/lrspeiser/ForceRank)
> A party game for structured debates and messy opinions. Rank your preferences, argue with friends, repeat.

### 🧩 [Kazuke](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Kazuke)
> A language-model-assisted puzzle game for practicing mental math and strategic planning.

### 🔁 [Node-GPT-Template](https://github.com/lrspeiser/Node-GPT-Template)
> A boilerplate for building apps with GPT — complete with chat streaming and user session persistence.

### 🌀 [RotationalCosmology](https://github.com/lrspeiser/RotationalCosmology)
> What if Gödel was right and redshift came from a spinning universe? A data-driven hypothesis and visualization experiment in astrophysics.

## 👨‍💼 About Me

Since graduating from MIT in 1996, I've:
- 🚀 Founded **Clover** (now processing $300B+ in payments under Fiserv)
- 💼 Co-founded **Bix** (acquired by Yahoo!)
- 🛒 Led product initiatives at **eBay** and **Intuit**
- 💵 Worked on IPOs like **Amazon** at **Credit Suisse First Boston**
- 🧠 Currently run **Horizon 3 Venture Studio**, launching fintech and SaaS companies in collaboration with Fortune 500s like **JLL** and **Prudential**

In my spare time, I mentor the amazing students of [Spartan Robotics](https://www.frc971.org/) — **FRC teams 971 and 9484** — based in Mountain View, CA.

## 🤖 Philosophy

I treat LLMs like junior engineers with superpowers:
- I give them instructions.
- They write the code.
- I direct, debug, and deploy.

Coding knowledge is optional in the age of AI. Imagination, curiosity, and good prompts are not.

## 🧠 Let's Connect

Follow or reach out if you're:
- Building with AI tools but not a coder.
- Interested in the frontier of LLM-human collaboration.
- A student, mentor, or robotics nerd.
